# zodToEffect demo

An example showing how to use [`@traversable/schema`](https://github.com/traversable/schema) to
convert `zod` schemas to `Effect/Schema`.

This implementation is incomplete, but it includes a partial runtime conversion as well as a `zod` schema to `Effect/Schema`
in string form, if you wanted to use a Vite plugin to (for example) write the Effect schemas to disc at build- or compile-time.

Good luck!
